To make absolutely sure that the file object gets closed, you should call the close() function as it is considered good programming practice. When the Python program/script is running, it leaves the files open, if close() is not called with a few exceptions. What we also learn here is that file objects use up system ressources which shouldn't be used anymore when the file operations are already done, as this would be considered bad practice and a waste of system ressources while the code is running. So in most cases, Python takes care of closing the file objects properly by itself, however, use the close() method in combination with open(). There is no reason not to use it.
